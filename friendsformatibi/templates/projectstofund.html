              <h3>Education</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Thanks to the longstanding support of the Leopold Bachmann Foundation, we have successfully established a functional self-learning center called «Nook» in Ward 3, Mwenezi. A Ward is a political unit similar to a municipal office in a canton. In our case, a canton is roughly equivalent to a district, specifically «Rutenga,» while the province of Masvingo, where Ward 3 is located, is approximately the size of Switzerland.

                In the fourth and current learning cycle, over 90 individuals have registered to collectively explore what they want to learn to improve their economic, ecological, and social situations, thus contributing to the overall development of the community. Just at the beginning of this year Ward 2 and Ward 3 were put together, resuliting in a vast area spanning approximately 40 kilometers in radius. For those from the outskirts of Ward 2 and 3 and neighboring wards, the daily commute is too far, making the Nook inaccessible to them.

                Some young men have temporarily rented rooms in nearby village houses to be part of the Nook, but the financial commitment is often too high, causing them to discontinue the cycle prematurely. For women, sleeping outside their homestead is culturally challenging.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <br>
                Goals
              </h4>
              <p>
                With the Nook Hostel, we aim to provide accommodation for people who want to participate in the Nook program from a distance. The hostel will have separate dormitories for men and women. The primary goal is to make the Nook more open and inclusive with the Nook Hostel.
                <br>
                Another objective is to operate the Nook Hostel as a small business run by Nook Fellows. Fellows are individuals who have completed a cycle and successfully implemented their own projects. They understand the Nook logic and serve as multipliers of values and principles. Anyone has the opportunity to become a Nook Fellow through personal commitment. Fellows will learn what it means to run a hostel and the long-term activities involved. Accommodation prices should be very low, possibly even workable, to align with the primary goal.
                The project involves a construction phase and an operational phase. Our request pertains to the initial construction costs, with the operation intended to cover its expenses. For construction, we will follow traditional architecture and use local materials. Local experts will collaborate with learners to build the hostel. We will also receive support from organizations such as Scope Zimbabwe and Kufunda Village, which already have constructed their buildings ecologically using local knowledge and materials.
                <br>
                The hostel will be integrated into our permaculture activities around the Nook, created as a prototype by the learners. Water retention with ponds and channels will help transform the hostel into a green garden. Outdoor areas like a fire pit, playground, and meeting spot under trees will gradually develop organically based on the initiatives of the Nook operators.
                For the initial construction, we rely on borehole water and solar power—technologies already familiar to Nook Fellows and learners, who can mostly implement them themselves.

                Ward 3 Mwenezi, District Rutenga, Masvingo, Zimbabwe</p>
                <h4>Duration</h4>
                <h5>Phase 1: Community Mobilization – Q1 2024</h5>
                <p>Identify expertise within the community. Determine who is willing to participate in construction. Identify external expertise needed.</p>
                <h5>Phase 2: Planning – Q2 2024</h5>
                <p>Create simple architectural plans. Options include A-frame houses with high thatched roofs, two stories, or traditional round houses. Integrate the Nook Hostel into the permaculture and water management concept of the Nook with gardens, trees, shrubs, water reservoirs, and channels, gray and black water treatment.</p>
                <h5>Phase 3: Construction – Q3 and Q4 2024</h5>
                <p>Local construction workers using organic materials, supplemented by external experts for knowledge exchange and construction guidance. Permaculture-integrated sanitation facilities, solar installation on the roof, borehole, solar-powered pump, and water tank.</p>
                <h5>Phase 4: Opening and operation – 2025 and beyond</h5>
                <p>The running cost should be covered by a minimum fee of the learners and with external visitors. They will be very minimal consisting of two small salaries of Nook fellows and maintenance and repairs on the existing infrastructure. Additionally, the hostel needs to pay into a fund for the long-term maintenance of the buildings and for future expansion if needed and if the operating concept is successful. </p>
                <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                <p>People from Ward 3 and neighboring wards who want to participate in the Nook program but cannot commute daily due to the distance. Nook Fellows working on projects within the Nook and advocating for its impact. External visitors interested in understanding the Nook and its community impact.</p>
                <h4>Vision of Impact</h4>
                <p>The Nook Hostel will become the center for individuals committed to economic, social, and ecological transformation in the Nook and its surroundings. It will serve as a role model for sustainable building and business. With the Nook Hostel, we can extend the benefits of the Nook to the outskirts and beyond the borders of Ward 3.</p>

              <h3>Sustainable Livelihood</h3>
              <p class="fst-italic">Welcome to the transformative Matibi Nook Hub Permaculture initiative, a pioneering project spearheaded by FFM (Friends For Matibi). This comprehensive undertaking is rooted in our commitment to holistic community development, seeking to integrate sustainable practices into the fabric of the Matibi community. As a cornerstone of our multifaceted approach, this project harmonizes with ongoing FFM endeavors, encompassing sustainable livelihoods, education, health, and the innovative Nook self-learning space.

                The Matibi Nook Hub Permaculture hopes to stand as a beacon of environmental stewardship and community resilience, aligning with FFM’s holistic approach, bringing new approaches and technologies to the Matibi community to solve the pressing challenges like water scarcity and low, unreliable harvest due to outdated agricultural structures and practices.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Matibi grapples with pressing environmental challenges, from rampant deforestation to soil infertility and acute water scarcity. The actual ways of doing agriculture are no longer providing the people of Matibi with reliable and sustainable food. Crops are seeded only to dry out when rain is missing. This is more and more the case over the last ten years due to climate change which heavily affects the semi-arid area of Matibi turning it into a desert. Food production is not even enough to feed the families, leading to famines where only food from outside prevents people from starving – not to think about selling food to the market to make an income.

                The shift in rains due to climate change leads to less groundwater, with the consequence of dry boreholes. The dams that were built 70 years ago, are not having enough capacity to cater water during the long periods of drought. The livestock is mostly strolling on the land looking for food and water leading to thin livestock that give less meat as would be possible and therefore livestock is sold to bad market prices, that’s if they survive.

                People do stick to their traditional ways of doing agriculture because they don’t know an alternative way and because experimenting with new ways of farming and building up new technologies and adequate infrastructure is too expensive in the beginning. These old structures trap the farmers into a vicious cycle of having less and less the capacity to break the old patterns.
            </p>
            <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            <p>The Matibi Nook Hub Permaculture project, guided by FFM, is a pivotal addition to our multifaceted initiatives within the Matibi community. Aligned with our commitment to sustainable livelihoods, education, health, and the innovative Nook learning space, permaculture serves as a holistic approach to enrich the lives of community members. Through ongoing projects like organic gardens, and borehole drilling, integrated with permaculture principles, our goal is to forge a resilient, self-sufficient community where farming for crops, vegetables and livestock are the foundations of a regenerative livelihood.

                By fostering harmonious coexistence with nature and incorporating diverse skills learned in our Nook, we envision a future where both people and the environment thrive. This initiative aspires to transform our learning center community into a sustainable and harmonious ecosystem, rejuvenating the landscape, enhancing biodiversity, and securing reliable resources.

                Through collaborative efforts, engagement with local and external expertise, and the integration of permaculture principles, we aim not only to address immediate challenges but also to pave the way for a resilient and thriving community in the long run.

            <p>
                With this proposal we are focusing on step 1, describing what it needs to create a showcase where the community is involved from the beginning. We would like to start with mobilization of already existing knowledge and resources, bring this together with external partners and already functioning permaculture projects in Zimbabwe to mutually learn, setup a dedicated learning space for permaculture at our Nook self-learning center and build a first showcase of how a functioning permaculture infrastructure could look like.
            </p>
            <p>
                A first important project will be a better water management system, with ponds and trenches that hold back and store the water locally and nearby the permaculture gardens. At the same time, we need to plant trees to shade the gardens and the collected water resources from the burning sun. Livestock can be used to fertilize and plough the land to make it ready for gardening in a coming year.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to better feed the livestock so people can get better prices on the market. Also we plan to open a local butcher shop to create community led and owned market access for the local livestock farmers. If you want to hear more about our innovative butchery projects that combines livestock with solar plants, contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
                People need to have housing nearby in order to make the cultivation of the land a pleasant experience without long and expensive traveling. Therefore, we plan to integrate a Nook hostel for the learners in general, accommodating the Nook permaculture learners from the community. The Nook hostel will also give stay for partners and visitors who want to support and observe the progress of the permaculture project. For the Nook hostel, there is a separate project description, please ask for it if you are interested in knowing more about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people involved from the community can stay at this first garden at the Matibi Nook, and start a living by cultivating the permaculture showcase, teaching others, and helping to bring the newly acquired concepts to schools and farms nearby in the community so the permaculture activities can naturally grow within the community.
            </p>

            <h4>Our Vision</h4>
            <p>
                We envision a Matibi community where permaculture practices are the new normal of how the community is doing farming and livestock breeding. We see a thousand green gardens, each having its own ponds and sinks for sustainable water management, healing the soil through sustainable permaculture practices in accordance with the livestock, shaded by trees that support the ecosystem of that farm and neighboring farms so they build a network of interwoven permaculture cells.
            </p>
            <p>
                We envision that the people of Matibi will live from their agricultural activities by producing enough food for their own needs and for selling it to the markets. We hope that all the permaculture producers will engage in a sort of a cooperative to bundle their market efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our learning center Nook and the permaculture infrastructure are envisioned to be an example for other communities. There are already 32 Nooks around the world in India, Bangladesh, Uganda, Ruanda and two in Zimbabwe. We want to expand the self-learning concept and contextualize the permaculture approach for rural communities so we can scale the benefits for other communities in Zimbabwe and even worldwide.
            </p>
            <h4>Existing projects and partnerships</h4>
            <p>
                We are already in exchange with SCOPE Zimbabwe who will help us to build up the permaculture infrastructure. They also will support us in the Nook hostel setup as they have a small ecovillage already built north of Harare where housing and permaculture are harmoniously combined. SCOPE is very active in schools and colleges which will help us in step 2 of the project
            </p>
            <p>
                The same is true for Kufunda village who are south of Harare combining learning, living, and permaculture in their ecovillage. The way Kufunda has constructed their classrooms is a role model for our next generation Nook buildings. The traditional way is costing less, using local materials and acting as a natural air conditioning for the classrooms. We are also in contact with Chikukwa and Umuntu with first get-to-know-each-other sessions.

                Total budget for 2024: USD 53’000.-
            </p>
            <p>For the upcoming years, we are estimating the same amount of money for school education programs and support for transforming existing farms into permaculture sites. With the knowledge acclaimed in the prototyping phase, we are able to transform an existing farm into a permaculture site with USD 15’000.- depending on the available water resources and another USD 15’000.- for the school gardens. </p>
            <p>At the same time, we will invite school learners and community volunteers to our Nook to acquire the permaculture knowledge at our showcase site. The costs for this will be covered by the regular running budget of the Nook once the showcase site is up and running. </p>
            <h4>Your support </h4>
            <p>We are looking for financial donors and knowledge and support partners to build a network of resources. We already have knowledge and support partners from Zimbabwe and Switzerland like SCOPE, Kufunda, EAWAG, Fachhochschule OST and many more. The Oak Foundation with its regenerative agriculture program also showed interest and we handed in a concept note recently. The Leopold Bachmann Stiftung is a long-standing partner of ours and we are in direct exchange around all of our activities with them. We are eager to learn more about other partners that we could contact and who are willing to support us with know-how and in kind work. </p>
            <p>Financially, we will contribute from our own financial means one third of what is needed. We are confident that we will be able to find two to three donors who are willing to fill the gap of the missing two third. We are looking for USD 35’000.- to start this long term project in the first year. </p>

          <h4>Update, September 2, 2022</h4>
          <p>Four new boreholes for two existing gardens and two new gardens for primary school and hospital.</p>
          <p class="h6">FINAL REPORT FOR DRILLING 2022</p>
          <p class="h6">Introduction</p>
          <p>Barely three months after drilling two boreholes in the gardens of Tamuka and Njeremoto and restoring their irrigation systems for a total cost of USD 14,500, the FFM has embarked on another SLI mega project. The new project involved USD 12,920 to drill four boreholes in Banda, Chimurudze, Tashinga and Tazvida gardens, which are scheduled to be supplied with drip irrigation in early 2023. Tashinga is a garden for hospital staff, Tazvida is a school garden and the other two are regular community gardens. The new boreholes bring the total number of gardens served by FFM boreholes to 8, including Tamuka, Njeremoto, Ruzambu and Kotamaurime. The FFM Trust aims to create 24 drip-irrigated organic gardens in the Matibi community by 2025. The 8 gardens already drilled are part of the first tranche of 12 which is expected to be completed next year 2023.</p>
          <h6>How the project went down</h6>
          <p>The preliminary work for this project involved 4 bids for drilling using the wet drilling method. Three drilling companies bid $4,200 per well but Riverton Investments which had previously bid $3,500 offered the service at $3,230 to get a discount. Finally, the cost for all four wells was $12,920 which included surveying, drilling, PVC casing and preliminary capacity testing. After the terms and conditions were approved, the contract was signed and work commenced on Sunday 14 August.</p>
          <p>The Chimurudze borehole was the first to be drilled and it was located almost 100m from the garden according to the survey. The second borehole, Banda, was drilled on the same day, August 15, very close to the garden, but the driller suffered two breakdowns before it was successful. The third and fourth boreholes were at Tashinga (80m from the garden) and Tazvida (in the garden plot), where drilling took more time and consumed more diesel due to the hard dolerite rock. In total, the 4 boreholes took 3 days to complete as there were some incidents that hampered the work such as two incidents where the drilling rig vehicle got stuck in the mud. All boreholes yielded abundant water starting at a depth of about 10 meters and drilling continued to a depth of 60 meters.</p>
          <p>The money for the completed boreholes was transferred on the day of completion but unfortunately the fund faced some problems in the banking system. The bank in Masvingo was late in communicating some important changes, which delayed the arrival of the money. At the time of writing, the money had not yet arrived in the FFM escrow account. The money transferred was the said USD 12,920 and about USD 150 meant as tokens for agricultural advisors.</p>
          <p>The work to install drip irrigation in these 4 gardens will appear in the 2023 annual plan.</p>

          <h4>Update, September 25, 2021 by Adnos Chikomo</h4>
          <p>Two new gardens are now fenced (Banda and Chimurudze) and their toilets are being built, bringing the total number of gardens to 6 now. The Agriculture Officer agreed that there will be no new gardens next year as there is still a lot of work to be done in the existing gardens. Officials said that two pumps (for Njeremoto and Kotamaurime) have failed, which may have something to do with the pumping capacity, which should be reviewed before increasing the number of irrigated gardens. The garden in Tamuka, which lost its solar panels (4 pieces), is still struggling to replace them.
            An interesting level of commitment is evident in the gardens as production has never stopped regardless of the challenges mentioned. The gardens have even held local agricultural exhibitions called field days.
            The need to diversify activities in the existing gardens was also noted, which means that each garden wants to raise small livestock and keep honey bees to intensify activities in the facilities. This speaks to the importance of dew ponds and bee houses, which cannot take place as planned in 2021 but must not be cancelled in 2022 before moving on to the creation of new gardens in 2023. The contractor drilling a borehole in Ruzambu has been given until the end of September to continue the work or abandon it.</p>
            <h4>Update – September 28, 2020</h4>
            <p>Matibi Municipality intends to cover the entire ward 3 of Mwenezi District with organic gardens. Consultations have been held with the Ministry of Agriculture which concluded that 10 organic gardens are needed to meet the most pressing, immediate needs. So far there are 4 gardens of this type, created with the help of the FFM. Of these, Tamuka and Njeremoto gardens already have drip irrigation systems installed (unfortunately Tamuka is struggling to replace the stolen solar panels). The other two are Ruzambu and Kotamaurime which are willing to receive these solar powered irrigation systems as well. The new requirements for a targeted organic garden to receive irrigation funds include the construction of Blair toilets, a garden constitution and the allocation of a security guard to garden the facilities. The two new gardens are located along the large Lundi River near Ruzambu and Ruzogwe schools respectively.</p>
            <p>When the current project was ready for execution in September 2019, it was stopped to first resolve the issue of the guarantee. By the time this issue was resolved, the bids were already a year old. The project coordinator approached the Irrigation Services Company to reconfirm their prices, which fortunately have not changed. This was also an opportunity to compare with other service providers. Leenomy Investments, Aqua Chem and Konicy Investments also submitted their own bids (which were far above Irrigation Services). Finally, the Irrigation Services company was retained, whose combined bid for both gardens is USD 20,690. Ruzambu Garden receives USD 10,555 while Kotamaurime Garden receives USD 10,135. Together with the community contribution of USD 8,098, the total cost of the project is USD 28,788.</p>
            <hr class="hr" />
            <p>Friends for Matibi is running a long-term project on the topic of "organic gardening" and "permaculture", a type of cultivation that is becoming increasingly popular in Africa. Under the guidance of the agricultural engineer responsible for Matibi, Jemitius Petudszai, the local women cultivate the fields with native plant species that are better equipped to withstand drought and pest infestation. The aim of the organic gardening project is to ensure self-sufficiency in Matibi in the first step. After that, surpluses can also be sold on the market.</p>
            <p>A new garden construction starts with the construction of protective fences to protect against theft by humans and animals. In the second step, we equip the gardens with solar pumps and irrigation systems for the water supply. At the same time, the appropriate seeds are purchased, after which the training of the agricultural engineer begins.</p>
            <p>Our garden project is therefore a pilot project for the entire region. However, we currently only have the resources to build two new gardens per year. The CHF 36,000 budgeted here is intended for two new gardens in 2020.</p>
